## Before enjoying the page
> Certain pages are reserved for university people, so you have to log in to view them, or you will see an error page. <br>
> To log in you need to log in with your university email (or you will be redirected to an error page).

## Notes
*Note 1*: After running locally, in the console there should be two messages `"MySQL Connection Successful"` and `"Example app listening at http://localhost:3000"`. If a different message appears, it is most likely that there is an error with the passwords.

*Note 2*: The website was previously available at `http://canchasup.live/`, but now it cannot be accessed because it has been discontinued.

*Note 3*: This repository is a copy of the original project, it was just uploaded again. The original project can be seen in my other account: `https://github.com/AlanNoSauqui/Proyecto-Canchas`

#### Enjoy :)
